# Introduction to FastAPI

# Why FastAPI?

- One of the main reasons to use FastAPI is its speed. It is one of the fastest Python web frameworks available, thanks to its asynchronous nature and the use of modern technologies such as async/await and type hints. This means that your APIs will be able to handle a large number of requests in a short amount of time, making them suitable for high-performance applications.

- Another reason to use **FastAPI** is its simplicity and ease of use. The framework is designed to be easy to learn and use, even for developers new to building APIs. It has a clean and straightforward API, and the documentation is well-written and easy to understand. Additionally, it provides easy integration with other libraries, such as SQLAlchemy and Motor for database management and Pydantic for data validation. This makes it easy to start building your API and increases the development speed.
