# Introduction to Python Library
* The major difference between __frameworks__ and __libraries__ is complexity. __Libraries__ offer fewer complexities, and __frameworks__ are the opposite. A __library__ is a _collection of packages that performs specific operations_.

# Library vs. Module
* __Module__ is a single Python file that contains reusable code. It is used to organize and group related functionality together. Modules are imported using the __import__ statement, and once imported, their contents can be accessed using dot notation.

* On the other hand, a __library__ is a _collection of modules or packages_ that provide additional functionality to Python. A library typically consists of multiple modules that are related to each other, and it can be installed and managed using a package manager like pip. Libraries often provide higher-level functionality that is built on top of the built-in Python functionality, and they can be used to solve more complex problems.
