# Introduction to Recursive Functions
* __Function recursion__ means a defined function can call itself.

* __Recursion__ is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.

* The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.

# Why Use Recursion?
* Most programming problems are solvable without recursion. So, strictly speaking, __recursion__ usually isnâ€™t necessary. However, some situations particularly lend themselves to a self-referential definition. __Factors to consider include:__
    * For some problems, a recursive solution, though possible, will be awkward rather than elegant.
    * Recursive implementations often consume more memory than non-recursive ones.
    * In some cases, using recursion may result in slower execution time.

* Typically, the readability of the code will be the biggest determining factor. But it depends on the circumstances.
