# enumerate() function

* In Python, __enumerate()__ is a built-in function that allows iterating over an __iterable object__ (e.g., list, tuple, string) and provides both the element and its index at the same time. The __enumerate()__ function takes an iterable as an argument and returns an iterator over pairs containing the index and value of each element.

* the index can be any integer value, positive, negative, or zero. When using enumerate() function, the index starts from 0 by default but it can be changed by providing a second argument to the function, specifying the starting index.
