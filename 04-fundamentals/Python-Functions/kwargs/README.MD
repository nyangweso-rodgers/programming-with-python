# Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, **kwargs


# Keyword Arguments
* You can also send arguments with the _key = value_ syntax. This way the order of the arguments does not matter.

# Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, **kwargs
* If you do not know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into your function, add two asterisk: __**__ before the parameter name in the function definition.

* This way the function will receive a _dictionary of arguments_, and can access the items accordingly:

* The phrase __Keyword Arguments__ are often shortened to __kwargs__ in Python documentations.

# Remarks:
* _It is used where you want the user to enter the parameter name also followed by argument._
