    def some_func(array):
        array = iter(array)
        try:
            first = next(array)

        return all(first == x for x in array)
```

- The given code snippet defines a function named `some_func` in Python.

  - `array = iter(array)`: The input array is converted into an **iterator** using the `iter()` function. This allows the use of the `next()` function to retrieve elements one by one.
  - `try...except StopIteration`: The code attempts to get the first element of the **iterator** using `next(array)`. If the iterator is empty (i.e., there are no elements left), it raises a `StopIteration` exception, indicating that there are no more items in the iterator.
  - `return True`: If the `StopIteration` exception is caught, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the array are the same or the array is empty.
  - `return all(first == x for x in array)`: If the first element is successfully retrieved without raising a `StopIteration` exception, the function uses a generator expression and the `all()` function to check if all subsequent elements in the iterator are equal to the first element (first). If they are, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

- In summary, the function checks whether all elements in the input array are the same. If the array is empty, it returns `True`. If the array is not empty, it compares each element to the first element, and if all elements are equal, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
